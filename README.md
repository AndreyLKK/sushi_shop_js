This project is a web page focused on demonstrating the capabilities of the JavaScript language. The layout of the page is simple, with an emphasis on the functional part. The goal of the project is to learn and practice the various elements of JavaScript. The project was later redesigned using the Vue 3 framework. The Vue 3 implementation is also available on this GitHub page.
